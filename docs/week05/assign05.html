                    the world due to its vast expanse of jungle. It is home to the largest variety of freshwater fish on
                    the planet and a variety of exotic mammals such as the pink river dolphin, manatee, jaguar, cougar,
                    giant otter, peccary, tapir, capybara, sloth and various primates. The world's largest river turtle
                    and alligator are also found there. It is made up of forests of all kinds, with an incredible number
                    of trees, such as Itahuba, Caricari, Tajibos, Cedro, Cuta barcina, Almandrillo and others. In
                    addition, the best medicinal plants capable of curing all kinds of diseases grow there. It is a
                    paradise full of magic, with wild flowers of peculiar beauty and great color.

                    The Colombian Amazon is made up of the Andes mountain range and plains that extend eastward to the
                    borders with Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela. Sharing with these countries the Amazon
                    Rainforest, which has one of the greatest biodiversity on the planet. The second longest and
                    mightiest river on the planet, the Amazon River, runs through the Amazon. Which contains more water
                    than the Nile, the Yangtze and the Mississippi combined. This river also has the largest
                    hydrographic basin in the world, around 7.05 million square kilometers, being one fifth of the
                    world's river flow. The basins located in Colombia that drain into the Amazon River are the Caquetá
                    and Putumayo rivers. Also within the most important rivers are the Guaviare, Apaporis and
                    Vaupés.<br>

                    gardeners of the Amazon and the Planet. Every time an indigenous people is exterminated and

                    ”. (Wise Bernardo Alves, from the Sateré-Mawé indigenous people). The disappearance of a culture can
                    be as serious or more serious than the disappearance of an animal or plant species. The imposition
                    of a hegemonic style of life linked to a mode of production can be as harmful as the alteration of
                    ecosystems.<br>

                <p id="paragraf3">The island of the Micos or Arara Island is a fluvial island of the Amazon River
                    belonging to Colombia, located in the municipality of Leticia, southeast of the department of
                    Amazonas, near the border with Peru. The island is about 20 kilometers upriver from the city of
                    Leticia, at the height of the town of Santa Sofía. The island has a size of around 450 hectares.
                    American Mike Tsalikys established a station there in the 1960s to raise monkeys and other living
                    things. The animals were mainly sold for experimental purposes, but animal experiments were also
                    conducted on site.

                <p>
                    Mike Tsalikys' company had to cease operations in the 1990s. Since then, the island has become a
                    tourist attraction. Leticia offers boat trips with a travel time of around one hour. Today there are
                    several thousand monkeys on the island, mostly squirrel monkeys. At the north end of the island
                    there is a visitor station with mooring facilities. The keepers there have used the animals for
                    visiting groups. The Amazon never ceases to amaze, adventure, contemplation and contact with nature
                    make the cell phone only important to take pictures that will help others see what we saw but that
                    will never make them feel what we feel, Unless, of course, they travel, live and enjoy the Amazon as
                    the most exciting visit of all that can be made.
