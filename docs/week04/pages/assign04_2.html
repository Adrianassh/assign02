                <h2>HISTORY</h2>

                <p class="trt1 trx1">
                    Pedro Heredia, part of a noble family in Spain. He was a conqueror. He was born in Madrid around
                    1520 and died in the Atlantic Ocean in 1554. He explored the coast and part of the interior of
                    Colombia. Due to some political scares and some appointments that he had decided to found the city
                    of Cartagena, although this happened between January 20 and 21, 1533, the official date of the
                    foundation of this great city was June 1 of the same year.
                    Cartagena was key to the independence of Colombia, starting with something called the Revolution de
                    los Commoners, where around the years 1752-1764 and 1767 the first mutinies against the Spanish yoke
                    were presented, initially they only wanted the tax burden represented in taxes and that drowned the
                    inhabitants of the colony. To stop these riots, the Spanish decided to kill each leader of the
                    community members to avoid further revolts. A vase, a simple vase became the symbol of every
                    Colombian as it unleashed the cry for independence from Colombia on July 20, 1810 in the city of
                    Santa Fe de Bogota. After more than three centuries of conquest of the Spanish empire, the
                    independence feeling spread in America. Cartagena achieved its total independence on November 11,
                    1811 and from then on it was key to the independence of the entire country.

                <p class="trt2 trx2">
                    Throughout the year the climate of Cartagena is hot, it is a tropical climate, although there are
                    some minimal changes that go according to seasonal temperature changes, and this is mostly due
                    to the amount of rain that falls more than the temperature of the city. therefore, two periods in
                    the year can be easily distinguished. The first runs from December to April, in which it only rains
                    6 days, and the second from May to November, with October being the month in which it rains the most
                    and the month in which it is least recommended to travel to take vacations, approximately 90 days.
                    of rain, however the temperature of the city does not vary, having a maximum temperature of 30 C to
                    31 C, in fact the lowest temperatures that could occur range from 23 C to 25 C. The humidity is 80%,
                    however the blowing of the wind, especially after the sunset,
                    <span>brings a refreshing relief for those who visit the city.</span>
